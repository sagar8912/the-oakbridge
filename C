Proceed with ONLY Slice 3 — Knowledge Base Publish → Cache Revalidation.

Do NOT start Reader UI, Vision integration, search, RAG, chatbot, MCP, or unrelated work.

Current state:
- Slice 1a authorization hardening is complete.
- Slice 2 approved/current article body API is complete.
- Hybrid scoped read model is established.
- Remaining identified gap: cache invalidation is not yet correctly wired from publish/update flows.

GOAL:
When an authorized KB article is published or an approved article is updated, all relevant cached approved-content reads must be invalidated so users never continue seeing permanently stale content.

Before coding:

1. Trace the complete existing publish/update flow.
2. Identify:
   - unstable_cache usage
   - cache keys
   - cache tags
   - POST /api/kb/revalidate or equivalent
   - article publish/approve actions
   - approved body API caching from Slice 2
3. Show exactly where stale-cache risk currently exists.
4. Propose the smallest safe fix.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. Publishing an article must invalidate the cached approved/current article body.

2. Updating and publishing a new approved version must invalidate:
   - article-detail cache
   - relevant article-list/category cache only where required
   - any scoped approved-content cache introduced in Slice 2

3. Prefer targeted cache invalidation.
Do NOT clear the entire Knowledge Base cache unnecessarily.

4. Cache tags/keys must use stable identifiers such as article ID/slug/code.

5. Draft edits that are NOT published should NOT unnecessarily invalidate the public/approved reader cache unless required by the current architecture.

6. After publish/revalidation:
   Old approved content
       ↓
   cache invalidated
       ↓
   next authorized read
       ↓
   new approved/current content

7. Preserve:
   - authorization
   - existing publish semantics
   - versioning
   - SQL PDP/PEP architecture

8. Do not decide or modify unrelated C2-C5 business decisions.

TESTS REQUIRED:

1. Fetch approved article and populate cache.
2. Update draft without publishing → approved reader still receives existing approved content.
3. Publish new approved version.
4. Relevant cache invalidates.
5. Next read returns new approved content.
6. Unrelated article cache is not unnecessarily invalidated.
7. Unauthorized publish/revalidation blocked.
8. Failed publish does not incorrectly invalidate valid content.
9. Repeated revalidation is safe/idempotent.

Before editing show:
- Current publish flow
- Current cache flow
- Root cause/gap
- Exact files proposed for change

Then implement Slice 3 only.

After implementation provide:
1. Files changed
2. Cache flow before vs after
3. Cache tags/keys used
4. Publish/revalidation sequence
5. Tests added
6. Exact test commands and results
7. Remaining risks

Stop after Slice 3. Do not start Reader UI or Vision integration until I explicitly approve.
