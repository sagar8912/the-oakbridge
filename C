Act as a Principal Software Architect / Staff Full-Stack Engineer specializing in enterprise authorization systems, PDP/PEP architecture, RBAC, ABAC, Microsoft Entra ID integration, secure multi-tenant applications, and production-grade permission migrations.

We need to evolve the existing authorization architecture based on the requirements discussed with John.

This is NOT a request to rewrite authentication or immediately replace every existing permission check.

The objective is to establish production-safe SCAFFOLDING for a centralized PDP/PEP authorization model that can gradually replace hard-coded role-based authorization.

IMPORTANT:

Before writing any code, perform a complete audit of the existing authorization implementation.

Do not make assumptions about the current schema.

Do not break existing working role permissions.

Do not perform a big-bang authorization rewrite.

Do not change unrelated business functionality.

Preserve backward compatibility while introducing a clean migration path.

==================================================
1. BUSINESS CONTEXT / JOHN'S REQUIREMENT
==================================================

Today, much of the application's authorization appears to be based on predefined roles such as:

- Super Admin
- Admin
- Team Admin
- Team Owner
- Member / Normal User

For example, the application may currently have logic conceptually similar to:

if user.role === "super_admin":
    allow delete goal

or:

if isSuperAdmin(user):
    allow transfer goal

This works for basic role-based authorization but becomes restrictive as business requirements evolve.

John wants the authorization model to support BOTH:

1. Role-based default capabilities

AND

2. Individual/user-specific permissions or attributes.

Example:

A Super Admin may automatically receive:

- goal.delete
- goal.archive
- goal.transfer
- goal.transfer.approve
- item.delete
- item.archive
- user.manage
- etc.

Conceptually:

SUPER_ADMIN
    ↓
Collection of default permissions
    ↓
permission A
permission B
permission C
...
permission N

However, John wants us to be able to take a user who is NOT a Super Admin and grant that person one specific capability.

Example:

Normal User / Team Admin
    +
explicit permission:
        goal.delete
    ↓
User can delete Goals

WITHOUT:

- promoting them to Super Admin
- giving them every Super Admin capability
- hard-coding their email/name/user ID
- creating another special role just for this case

Therefore:

ROLE = baseline/default capabilities

USER-SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES/PERMISSIONS = additive or potentially policy-driven capabilities

The architecture must support this future state.

==================================================
2. TARGET AUTHORIZATION MODEL
==================================================

Design the system around:

Authentication
      ↓
Authenticated User Context
      ↓
PEP — Policy Enforcement Point
      ↓
PDP — Policy Decision Point
      ↓
Centralized Permission / Attribute Policy Data
      ↓
ALLOW / DENY
      ↓
Business Action

Conceptual request:

canUser({
    subject: currentUser,
    action: "goal.delete",
    resource: goal,
    context: {
        teamId,
        ownerId,
        environment
    }
})

PDP evaluates:

- user's roles
- role permissions
- explicit user permissions
- relevant attributes
- team membership
- resource ownership
- contextual rules where required

Then returns:

ALLOW

or

DENY

Optionally include:

reason
policy/source
matchedPermission

The business code should not need to understand all authorization internals.

==================================================
3. FIRST: AUDIT THE EXISTING SYSTEM
==================================================

Before implementation, search the entire repository for authorization logic.

Identify:

- role checks
- Super Admin checks
- Admin checks
- Team Admin checks
- Team Owner checks
- permission helpers
- middleware
- route guards
- API authorization
- server actions
- database/RLS authorization
- Entra-derived roles/groups
- hard-coded role strings
- hard-coded user/email checks
- frontend visibility checks

Search patterns such as:

role ===
role !==
super_admin
superAdmin
isSuperAdmin
admin
team_admin
team_owner
canDelete
canEdit
canArchive
canTransfer
hasPermission
permissions.includes
authorize
isOwner

Produce an authorization inventory.

For every important permission check identify:

FILE
FEATURE
CURRENT CHECK
ROLE/PERMISSION USED
FRONTEND/BACKEND
SECURITY IMPACT
MIGRATION CANDIDATE

Do not blindly replace everything.

==================================================
4. CENTRAL PERMISSION CATALOG
==================================================

Introduce or extend a centralized permission catalog.

Do not scatter arbitrary strings throughout the code.

Example conceptual permissions:

GOALS

goal.create
goal.read
goal.update
goal.delete
goal.archive
goal.restore
goal.transfer
goal.transfer.approve
goal.transfer.reject

ITEMS / TODOS

item.create
item.read
item.update
item.delete
item.archive
item.restore
item.transfer
item.transfer.approve

TEAMS

team.create
team.update
team.delete
team.manage_members

KNOWLEDGE BASE

knowledge.read
knowledge.create
knowledge.update
knowledge.publish
knowledge.delete

ADMINISTRATION

user.manage
role.manage
permission.manage

Do NOT invent every possible permission if unnecessary.

First derive the initial catalog from actual existing application capabilities.

Use stable machine-readable permission keys.

==================================================
5. ROLE → DEFAULT PERMISSIONS
==================================================

Roles should become collections of default capabilities.

Conceptually:

SUPER_ADMIN
    ↓
many/all administrative permissions

ADMIN
    ↓
defined administrative subset

TEAM_ADMIN
    ↓
team-scoped permissions

TEAM_OWNER
    ↓
owner/team-specific permissions

MEMBER
    ↓
basic permissions

Create or extend a centralized mapping such as:

role_permissions

Conceptual schema:

role
permission_key
scope
created_at
updated_at

Avoid embedding permission lists separately in dozens of components.

IMPORTANT:

Do not change existing effective permissions accidentally.

The first migration should preserve current behavior.

If Super Admin can currently delete Goals, Super Admin must continue being able to delete Goals after introducing PDP/PEP.

==================================================
6. USER-SPECIFIC PERMISSIONS / ATTRIBUTES
==================================================

This is a critical part of John's requirement.

Support explicit permissions for individual users.

Conceptual model:

user_permissions

Fields could include:

id
user_id
permission_key
effect
scope_type
scope_id
granted_by
granted_at
expires_at
metadata

Example:

User:
John Doe

Role:
Team Admin

Default Team Admin permissions:
    goal.read
    goal.update
    goal.archive

Explicit additional permission:
    goal.delete

Effective result:

goal.read      → ALLOW
goal.update    → ALLOW
goal.archive   → ALLOW
goal.delete    → ALLOW

The user does NOT need to become Super Admin.

Do not hard-code individual users.

==================================================
7. FUTURE ABAC READINESS
==================================================

John specifically discussed introducing more attribute-based permissioning.

Design the authorization API so future policy decisions can consider attributes such as:

User attributes:
- role
- team memberships
- ownership relationships
- explicit permissions

Resource attributes:
- owner
- team
- status
- visibility
- resource type

Context:
- requested action
- source team
- target team
- workflow state

Example:

canUser({
    subject: user,
    action: "goal.archive",
    resource: goal
})

Could evaluate:

user has explicit goal.archive

OR

user's role grants goal.archive

OR

user is appropriate team administrator and policy permits it.

Do NOT build an unnecessarily complex generic policy language unless the repository already has one.

Build extensible scaffolding.

==================================================
8. PDP — POLICY DECISION POINT
==================================================

Create or extend ONE centralized policy decision layer.

Conceptually:

authorize({
    user,
    action,
    resource,
    context
})

or:

canUser(user, permission, resource?)

The PDP should answer:

ALLOW / DENY

It should centrally evaluate applicable policy sources.

Conceptual evaluation:

1. Validate authenticated user
2. Resolve identity
3. Resolve role/default permissions
4. Resolve explicit user permissions
5. Resolve relevant resource/context attributes
6. Apply policy rules
7. Return decision

Example:

const decision = await authorize({
    user: currentUser,
    action: "goal.delete",
    resource: goal
});

if (!decision.allowed) {
    throw ForbiddenError();
}

Do not duplicate this decision logic independently in each feature.

==================================================
9. PEP — POLICY ENFORCEMENT POINTS
==================================================

PDP decides.

PEP enforces.

Identify appropriate enforcement points:

SERVER/API
- API routes
- server actions
- mutations
- sensitive service methods

UI
- buttons
- menu items
- actions
- navigation

DATABASE/RLS
- where currently applicable

Critical rule:

UI permission checks are UX only.

SERVER-SIDE PEP IS MANDATORY.

Example:

Even if Delete Goal button is hidden:

A user manually calling:

DELETE /api/goals/{id}

must still be denied if PDP returns DENY.

Return:

403 Forbidden

using existing project conventions.

==================================================
10. EFFECTIVE PERMISSIONS
==================================================

Create a consistent way to calculate effective permissions.

Conceptually:

Effective Permissions
=
Role Default Permissions
+
Explicit User Permissions
+
Contextual/Attribute-Based Decisions

Do NOT simply merge everything blindly if DENY semantics already exist.

If explicit DENY overrides are supported, document precedence clearly.

Possible conceptual precedence:

explicit DENY
    ↓
explicit ALLOW
    ↓
role/default permissions
    ↓
contextual policies
    ↓
default DENY

But DO NOT invent this exact precedence if it conflicts with existing architecture.

Audit first and define deterministic behavior.

==================================================
11. APPLY TO CURRENT BUSINESS USE CASES
==================================================

Use the recently discussed features as initial PDP/PEP reference cases.

--------------------------------------------------
A. DELETE VS ARCHIVE
--------------------------------------------------

John discussed that hard delete should remain highly restricted.

Conceptually:

goal.delete

may initially belong only to Super Admin by default.

Archive may be broader:

goal.archive

could potentially be available to:

- Super Admin
- Admin
- Team Admin
- Team Owner

depending on scope/business policy.

But do not hard-code this across components.

Represent it through centralized permissions/policies.

This allows future changes without rewriting business logic.

--------------------------------------------------
B. GOAL TRANSFER
--------------------------------------------------

Separate permissions:

goal.transfer.request

goal.transfer.approve

goal.transfer.reject

A user may be able to REQUEST a Goal Transfer without being able to APPROVE it.

Also preserve the business rule:

REQUESTER MUST NOT APPROVE THEIR OWN REQUEST.

That contextual separation belongs in policy evaluation/enforcement.

--------------------------------------------------
C. INDIVIDUAL DELETE CAPABILITY
--------------------------------------------------

This directly represents John's example.

Suppose:

User X

Role:
Team Admin

Normally Team Admin does NOT have:

goal.delete

But an administrator explicitly grants:

goal.delete

Then:

PDP should return ALLOW for User X when appropriate.

Do not require changing User X's role.

Do not promote them to Super Admin.

This proves the architecture supports:

role defaults + individual capability.

==================================================
12. ENTRA ID RESPONSIBILITY
==================================================

Audit how Microsoft Entra identity/roles/groups currently enter the application.

Preserve Entra as the source of identity and any existing external role/group information.

But do not require every application-level granular permission to become a new Entra role/group.

Conceptually:

Entra
    ↓
Identity / groups / external role context
    ↓
Application user context
    ↓
Application authorization data
    ↓
PDP
    ↓
Decision

Document clearly:

What comes from Entra?

What is stored locally?

How are they combined?

Do not redesign authentication unless required.

==================================================
13. ADMINISTRATION / FUTURE MANAGEMENT
==================================================

Design the data model so a future admin interface can manage:

Roles

→ default permissions

Users

→ additional explicit permissions

Potential future UI:

User:
Jane Smith

Role:
Team Admin

Role Permissions:
✓ goal.read
✓ goal.update
✓ goal.archive

Additional Permissions:
✓ goal.delete
✓ goal.transfer.approve

Do NOT necessarily build the full UI now unless required by existing scope.

But the backend/data architecture must support it cleanly.

==================================================
14. AUDITABILITY
==================================================

Permission changes are security-sensitive.

Ensure permission assignments can be audited.

Capture where appropriate:

permission
subject/user
granted_by
granted_at
revoked_by
revoked_at
scope
reason/metadata if supported

For sensitive authorization actions, existing audit infrastructure should be reused.

We should eventually be able to answer:

Why could this user delete this Goal?

Example explanation:

ALLOW
because:
explicit user permission "goal.delete"
granted by Super Admin
on date X

or:

ALLOW
because:
role "super_admin"
includes "goal.delete"

==================================================
15. CACHE / SESSION CONSIDERATIONS
==================================================

Audit whether roles/permissions are cached in:

JWT/session
React context
server cache
database cache
middleware

Permission changes must not remain stale indefinitely.

Define safe invalidation/refresh behavior.

Example:

Admin grants:

goal.delete

User should receive the permission according to an intentional refresh strategy.

Do not introduce security bugs caused by stale authorization data.

==================================================
16. DEFAULT DENY
==================================================

For sensitive actions, authorization should follow:

No matching permission/policy
        ↓
DENY

Do not accidentally allow actions because a permission record is missing.

Sensitive mutations must fail closed.

==================================================
17. MIGRATION STRATEGY
==================================================

Do NOT replace the entire application's authorization in one change.

Use phased migration.

PHASE 1 — AUDIT

Map all existing authorization.

PHASE 2 — FOUNDATION

Introduce:

- permission catalog
- role-permission model
- user-specific permission model
- centralized PDP
- reusable PEP helpers

PHASE 3 — REFERENCE FEATURES

Migrate a small number of high-value features first:

- Goal Delete
- Goal Archive
- Goal Transfer request/approval

PHASE 4 — VALIDATION

Ensure behavior matches existing authorization except intentional enhancements.

PHASE 5 — GRADUAL MIGRATION

Move remaining hard-coded checks to PDP/PEP incrementally.

Do not attempt a risky big-bang migration.

==================================================
18. TESTING
==================================================

Add comprehensive authorization tests.

TEST 1:

Super Admin has default:

goal.delete

Expected:

ALLOW

TEST 2:

Normal User without:

goal.delete

Expected:

DENY

TEST 3:

Normal/non-Super-Admin user receives explicit:

goal.delete

Expected:

ALLOW according to scope.

TEST 4:

Remove explicit permission.

Expected:

DENY again unless another policy grants it.

TEST 5:

Team Admin has archive but not hard delete.

Expected:

Archive → ALLOW
Delete → DENY

according to configured policy.

TEST 6:

Goal Transfer requester:

goal.transfer.request → ALLOW

but self approval:

goal.transfer.approve → DENY for own request.

TEST 7:

Authorized approver:

goal.transfer.approve → ALLOW.

TEST 8:

User manually calls protected API without permission.

Expected:

403.

TEST 9:

Frontend actions match effective permissions.

TEST 10:

Changing one user's explicit permission does not affect another user with the same role.

This is critical.

==================================================
19. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Never trust:

- role supplied by frontend
- permission supplied by frontend
- user ID supplied as authorization evidence

Use authenticated server-side identity.

Never implement authorization only by hiding UI.

Never hard-code:

specific user names
emails
Entra IDs
database UUIDs

Never grant a broad role simply because one individual capability is required.

==================================================
20. IMPORTANT SCOPE CONTROL
==================================================

John's request is to establish SCAFFOLDING for more sophisticated permissioning.

Do NOT over-engineer this into a complete IAM platform.

Do NOT:

- rewrite authentication
- replace Entra
- rewrite every authorization check immediately
- build an unnecessary policy language
- migrate unrelated functionality
- introduce dozens of speculative permissions

Build a clean, extensible foundation based on actual application requirements.

==================================================
21. REQUIRED OUTPUT BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION
==================================================

Before changing code, provide:

A. CURRENT STATE

Explain existing:

Authentication
Roles
Authorization
Entra integration
Permission checks

B. GAP ANALYSIS

Identify:

hard-coded role checks
duplicated authorization
frontend-only security
missing user-specific permissions
areas incompatible with PDP/PEP

C. TARGET ARCHITECTURE

Show:

Entra / Identity
        ↓
Authenticated User Context
        ↓
PEP
        ↓
PDP
        ↓
Role Permissions + User Permissions + Attributes
        ↓
ALLOW / DENY

D. DATABASE IMPACT

List required tables/changes/migrations.

E. MIGRATION PLAN

Explain how existing behavior remains backward compatible.

Only then implement the approved/minimal foundation.

==================================================
22. FINAL DELIVERABLE
==================================================

After implementation provide:

1. Existing authorization architecture discovered
2. Problems identified
3. PDP architecture introduced
4. PEP enforcement points introduced
5. Permission catalog
6. Role → permission mapping
7. User-specific permission mechanism
8. ABAC-ready/contextual design
9. Entra integration impact
10. Database migrations
11. Files changed
12. Existing hard-coded checks migrated
13. Remaining hard-coded checks / technical debt
14. Security validation
15. Automated test results
16. Manual UAT steps
17. Rollback strategy
18. Recommended next migration phase

Most importantly, demonstrate this exact requirement:

BEFORE:

Role = Super Admin
→ Can delete Goals

Role = Team Admin
→ Cannot delete Goals

AFTER:

Super Admin
→ goal.delete from ROLE DEFAULT
→ ALLOW

Team Admin
→ no goal.delete
→ DENY

Team Admin + explicit user permission "goal.delete"
→ ALLOW

Another Team Admin without explicit permission
→ DENY

This demonstrates the architecture John requested:

ROLE = baseline collection of capabilities

+

USER-SPECIFIC PERMISSIONS / ATTRIBUTES = granular additional capabilities

evaluated centrally through PDP

and enforced consistently through PEP.

Preserve all existing working functionality while establishing this foundation.
