Act as a Principal Full-Stack Engineer with 15+ years of experience building enterprise collaboration and prioritization systems.

We need to enhance the existing Voting functionality in the TOW application based on today’s client (John) feedback.

Current Behavior

* One user can cast only one vote per item.
* Vote options: Upvote (👍), Downvote (👎), or No Vote (null).
* Switching a vote automatically removes the previous vote and applies the new one.
* UI already displays 👍 count and 👎 count.
* Sorting currently uses only the Upvote count, which is incorrect.

Client Requirement (John)

1. Keep the existing UI

Do NOT remove the 👍 / 👎 columns.
John explicitly likes the current visual design.

2. Introduce a Net Vote Score

Add an internal calculation:

Net Score = Upvotes − Downvotes

Examples:

* 10 up / 5 down → Net = +5
* 7 up / 0 down → Net = +7
* 1 up / 1 down → Net = 0

3. Update Sorting Logic

When the user clicks the Votes column header (ascending/descending), sorting must use the Net Score, not just the Upvote count.

Expected order (descending):

1. Net +7
2. Net +5
3. Net +2
4. Net 0
5. Net -1

4. Add Weekly Reset Functionality

Implement a Reset Votes action.

Requirements:

* Visible only to authorized users (Admin / Super Admin).
* Can be placed near the Votes column or in an Actions menu.
* Reset sets every user’s vote on the selected scope back to NULL (no vote).
* After reset:
    * Upvotes = 0
    * Downvotes = 0
    * Net Score = 0
    * Individual vote records are cleared or marked inactive.

5. Preserve Auditability

Even after reset, we should be able to know that a reset occurred.

Add:

* reset_by
* reset_at
* reset_scope (item/list/team/global)

6. Database / Backend

Review the current vote schema and implement the minimal safe changes.

Ensure:

* One active vote per user per item.
* Unique constraint enforcement.
* Efficient aggregation queries for large lists.

7. API Requirements

Support:

* Cast vote
* Change vote
* Remove vote (back to null)
* Fetch aggregated counts
* Fetch current user vote
* Reset votes (admin only)

8. UI Requirements

Display:

* 👍 count
* 👎 count
* Optional hidden/internal net score

Sorting must visually work even if the net score column is not shown.

9. Manual UAT Scenarios

Implement and verify:

Scenario A — First vote

User A upvotes → 👍1 👎0 Net+1

Scenario B — Switch vote

User A changes to downvote → 👍0 👎1 Net-1

Scenario C — Multiple users

User A upvote, User B upvote, User C downvote → 👍2 👎1 Net+1

Scenario D — Sorting

Items are ordered by Net Score.

Scenario E — Reset

Admin clicks Reset → all counts become zero and users can vote again.

10. Constraints

Do NOT:

* Change the existing thumbs-up/thumbs-down UI.
* Introduce real-time sockets unless already present.
* Modify unrelated goal/item logic.
* Touch KB, RAG, MCP, Azure, or permission architecture work.

Deliverables

Provide:

1. Root cause of current sorting behavior.
2. Files changed.
3. Schema changes (if any).
4. API changes.
5. UI changes.
6. Test results.
7. Exact manual steps to verify the feature in Staging.

Implement this as a production-ready enhancement suitable for immediate Staging deployment and subsequent client UAT.
