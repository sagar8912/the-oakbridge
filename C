Continue Phase 1.B — Slice 7: Article Version Restore.

OBJECTIVE:
Implement safe restoration of historical article versions.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. VERSION HISTORY
    Expose a complete version timeline with:

* version number
* author
* timestamp
* approval state
* summary

2. DIFF VIEW
    Add side-by-side diff support for:

* title
* body markdown
* metadata

3. RESTORE FLOW
    Implement:

* Restore as Draft (required)
* Direct restore to Approved (NOT allowed)

Restoring a version must:

* create a new draft version
* preserve historical versions
* not overwrite history

4. API
    Add:

* GET /api/knowledge/articles/:id/versions
* POST /api/knowledge/articles/:id/restore

5. SECURITY
    Only editors/managers may restore.
    Readers have view-only access.
6. TESTS
    Cover:

* restore creates new version
* history preserved
* unauthorized restore blocked
* diff generation

7. STOP
    Provide migration changes (if any), APIs, UI routes, and UAT steps.
