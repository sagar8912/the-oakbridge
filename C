Slice 1a tests are passing.

Before moving to Slice 2, perform a final verification of Slice 1a only.

Confirm:
1. Viewer cannot mutate KB content.
2. Authorized Editor can save/edit permitted KB content.
3. Admin/Super Admin behavior is preserved.
4. Unauthenticated mutation is blocked.
5. Direct server/API mutation bypass is blocked.
6. No SQL PDP/PEP behavior was redesigned.
7. No unrelated functionality was modified.

Also review the remaining risks you identified and classify each as:
- Must fix before Slice 2
- Later Phase 1.B work
- Out of scope

Do not start Slice 2 yet.
