Act as a Principal Full-Stack Engineer / Solution Architect with strong experience in enterprise approval workflows, authorization, RBAC/ABAC, PDP/PEP, auditability, and secure multi-user applications.

We need to refine the existing Goal Transfer Approval Process / Pending Movements functionality according to the requirement discussed with John.

IMPORTANT:
First audit the complete existing implementation before changing anything.

Do NOT blindly rewrite the existing Goal Transfer workflow.
Do NOT break the existing Item Movements workflow.
Do NOT change unrelated functionality.
Reuse the existing architecture, database schema, authorization utilities, UI patterns, and APIs wherever possible.

CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY:

We already have:

My Items / Pending Movements
    ├── Item Movements
    └── Goal Transfers

Under Goal Transfers, a transfer request displays information such as:

- Goal
- Source Team
- Target Team
- Requested By
- Owner
- Goal Level
- Requested Date
- Status
- Actions:
    - Approve
    - Reject

Currently, a Goal Transfer request can appear in Pending Movements with Approve/Reject actions.

We need to make the visibility and authorization USER-SPECIFIC.

==================================================
CORE BUSINESS REQUIREMENT
==================================================

The user who INITIATES / REQUESTS a Goal Transfer must NOT be able to approve or reject their own transfer request.

Example:

User A requests:

Goal:
Testing Goal Delete

Source:
CLAIMS

Target:
Private Team Test

Requested By:
User A

Target Owner / appropriate receiving user:
User B

After User A submits the transfer:

User A must NOT receive Approve/Reject authority for their own request.

The approval request should instead become actionable for the appropriate authorized user responsible for approving the movement/transfer.

In simple terms:

REQUESTER != APPROVER

A user must never be able to approve/reject their own Goal Transfer request.

==================================================
1. REQUESTER EXPERIENCE
==================================================

When User A initiates a Goal Transfer:

1. Create a transfer request with status PENDING.
2. Do NOT immediately transfer the goal.
3. Store the requester identity securely using the authenticated user's server-side identity.
4. Determine the appropriate approver based on the existing team/permission model.
5. The requester must not receive Approve/Reject actions.

If the product should allow requesters to track their own submitted requests, they may see them in a separate read-only context such as:

"My Requests"

or an equivalent existing UI pattern.

For their own request they may see:

Goal
Source
Target
Requested Owner
Requested Date
Status = Pending / Approved / Rejected

But they MUST NOT see:

Approve
Reject

Do not create a new "My Requests" UI unnecessarily if an equivalent existing pattern already exists.

==================================================
2. APPROVER EXPERIENCE
==================================================

The transfer request should appear as actionable under:

My Items
    → Pending Movements
        → Goal Transfers

ONLY for users who are authorized to act on that request.

For an authorized approver, display:

Goal
Source Team
Target Team
Requested By
Proposed Owner
Goal Level
Requested Date
Status
Approve
Reject

The Approve and Reject buttons must only appear when:

1. Request status = PENDING
2. Current user is authorized to approve the request
3. Current user is NOT the requester

Example:

User A creates request
        ↓
Request becomes PENDING
        ↓
User A cannot approve/reject
        ↓
Authorized User B logs in
        ↓
Pending Movements → Goal Transfers
        ↓
User B sees request + Approve/Reject
        ↓
User B Approves or Rejects

==================================================
3. WHO SHOULD RECEIVE THE APPROVAL?
==================================================

Do NOT simply send approval actions to every user.

Audit the existing application's:

- team membership model
- team owner/admin roles
- Super Admin permissions
- existing Pending Movements authorization
- goal ownership
- target-team permissions
- PDP/PEP or permission helpers if already implemented

Determine the appropriate approver using the existing business rules.

Prefer the appropriate permissioned user associated with the TARGET team if that matches the current architecture/business rules.

Possible authorized approvers may include:

- target team owner
- target team admin
- appropriately permissioned user
- Super Admin as fallback/override if existing policy permits it

Do NOT hard-code a specific person's email/name/user ID.

Use IDs and permission relationships.

If the exact approver rule is ambiguous in the existing codebase, do not invent a silent business rule.

Implement the safest architecture using an explicit:

approver_user_id

or

approval_scope / permission check

and clearly document the assumption.

==================================================
4. CRITICAL SECURITY RULE — NO SELF APPROVAL
==================================================

This must be enforced at BOTH UI and backend levels.

Frontend hiding is NOT sufficient.

Backend rule:

if current_user.id == transfer_request.requested_by_user_id:
    reject authorization

Even if the requester manually calls the API using Postman/dev tools/direct HTTP request, they must NOT be able to approve or reject their own request.

Return an appropriate authorization response such as:

403 Forbidden

with a meaningful message:

"You cannot approve or reject your own goal transfer request."

Use the project's existing API/error conventions.

==================================================
5. PENDING MOVEMENTS VISIBILITY
==================================================

Fix the Pending Movements query so users only receive requests relevant to them.

Do NOT fetch every pending Goal Transfer and rely only on frontend filtering.

Server-side authorization/filtering is required.

Conceptually:

Actionable Pending Movements =
    pending requests
    where current user is an authorized approver
    AND current user != requester

If requester tracking is supported:

Submitted Requests =
    requests where requested_by_user_id = current_user.id

These two concepts must not be confused.

"Pending Movements requiring my action"

is different from:

"Requests submitted by me."

==================================================
6. APPROVE FLOW
==================================================

When an authorized approver clicks Approve:

Validate again on the server:

- request exists
- request status is PENDING
- current user is authorized
- current user != requester
- source/target teams still exist
- goal still exists
- transfer is still valid
- request has not already been processed

Then perform the transfer atomically.

Update:

status = APPROVED
approved_by = current_user.id
approved_at = timestamp

Apply the approved changes:

- target team
- selected owner
- goal level, if part of the transfer request
- other approved transfer metadata

The actual Goal must NOT move before approval.

After success:

- remove it from actionable Pending Movements
- show success feedback
- refresh relevant UI/cache
- preserve audit history

==================================================
7. REJECT FLOW
==================================================

When an authorized approver clicks Reject:

The Goal must remain unchanged.

Update request:

status = REJECTED
rejected_by = current_user.id
rejected_at = timestamp

If the application already supports comments/reasons, capture:

rejection_reason

If not, structure the implementation so it can be added later without major redesign.

Rejected requests must disappear from the actionable Pending list but remain available in audit/history where appropriate.

==================================================
8. CONCURRENCY / DUPLICATE ACTION PROTECTION
==================================================

Prevent:

- double approval
- approve after reject
- reject after approve
- duplicate button clicks
- stale requests being processed twice

Use transactional/atomic database behavior where supported.

Only a PENDING request can transition to:

PENDING → APPROVED

or

PENDING → REJECTED

Never:

APPROVED → REJECTED

or

REJECTED → APPROVED

through normal approval endpoints.

==================================================
9. AUDIT TRAIL
==================================================

Every request should preserve enough information to answer:

Who requested the transfer?
When?
From which team?
To which team?
Who was the proposed/new owner?
What goal level was requested?
Who approved/rejected?
When?
What was the final status?

Reuse existing audit infrastructure if available.

Do not introduce unnecessary duplicate audit systems.

==================================================
10. AUTHORIZATION / FUTURE PDP-PEP-ABAC READINESS
==================================================

John specifically wants the system to evolve away from hard-coded role-only permissions.

Therefore, do not write logic everywhere like:

if role === "super_admin"

Centralize authorization behind a permission/policy abstraction where possible.

Example conceptual permissions:

goal.transfer.request
goal.transfer.approve
goal.transfer.reject

The current role model may grant these permissions today, but the implementation should be compatible with future user-specific/attribute-based permissions.

This should support the future model:

Role
    ↓
Default permissions

+

User-specific attributes/permissions
    ↓
Additional capabilities

Do not implement an unnecessarily huge ABAC redesign in this task.

Just avoid introducing new hard-coded authorization technical debt.

==================================================
11. UI ACCEPTANCE SCENARIOS
==================================================

Test at minimum:

Scenario A — Requester

User A submits Goal Transfer.

Expected:

- request created as PENDING
- Goal does NOT immediately move
- User A cannot Approve
- User A cannot Reject
- direct API self-approval returns authorization failure

Scenario B — Authorized Approver

User B is authorized for the target/request.

Expected:

Pending Movements
→ Goal Transfers

shows the request.

Approve and Reject are available.

Scenario C — Approve

User B approves.

Expected:

- Goal moves to target team
- owner/level updates correctly
- request becomes APPROVED
- audit information saved
- request disappears from actionable Pending Movements

Scenario D — Reject

Create another transfer.

User B rejects.

Expected:

- Goal stays in original team
- ownership/level remain unchanged
- request becomes REJECTED
- request disappears from actionable Pending Movements

Scenario E — Unauthorized User

User C has no approval permission.

Expected:

- no actionable request shown
- no Approve/Reject actions
- direct API call denied

Scenario F — Super Admin

Verify behavior according to existing policy.

Super Admin may have broad approval rights, but even if Super Admin initiated their own request, explicitly evaluate and enforce the no-self-approval policy unless an existing documented business rule says otherwise.

Scenario G — Multiple Requests

Verify each request is independently scoped and users only see requests they are authorized to action.

==================================================
12. AUTOMATED TESTS
==================================================

Add/update tests for:

- requester cannot self-approve
- requester cannot self-reject
- authorized approver can see request
- authorized approver can approve
- authorized approver can reject
- unauthorized user cannot see/action request
- backend blocks unauthorized direct API calls
- Goal does not move while PENDING
- Goal moves only after APPROVED
- Goal remains unchanged after REJECTED
- processed request cannot be processed again
- audit fields are correctly stored
- Pending Movements query does not leak unrelated requests

Run:

- relevant unit tests
- integration tests
- type checking
- lint
- build if practical

Fix only issues caused by or directly related to this implementation.

==================================================
13. IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS
==================================================

Do not:

- hard-code Sagar, Sachin, John, or any specific user
- identify users by display name
- trust requester IDs supplied by frontend
- rely only on frontend button hiding
- expose all pending transfers to all users
- transfer the Goal before approval
- break existing Item Movements
- redesign unrelated authorization
- modify unrelated modules

Use authenticated server-side user identity and stable user IDs.

==================================================
14. BEFORE CODING
==================================================

First inspect and report:

1. Existing Goal Transfer implementation
2. Existing Pending Movements implementation
3. Current database tables/schema
4. Current authorization/role model
5. How current user identity is resolved
6. How target team membership/ownership is represented
7. Existing Item Movement approval pattern that can be reused
8. Exact files that need modification

Then implement the smallest production-safe change.

==================================================
15. FINAL OUTPUT
==================================================

After implementation provide:

1. Root cause / previous behavior
2. New end-to-end workflow
3. How approver eligibility is determined
4. How self-approval is prevented
5. Files changed
6. Database/migration changes, if any
7. API changes
8. Authorization changes
9. Tests added and results
10. Manual UAT steps for:
    - requester
    - approver
    - unauthorized user
11. Any assumptions or remaining risks

Final expected workflow:

User A
    ↓
Requests Goal Transfer
    ↓
PENDING
    ↓
No Approve/Reject for User A
    ↓
Authorized receiving/permissioned User B
    ↓
Pending Movements → Goal Transfers
    ↓
Approve / Reject
    ↓
APPROVE → Goal actually transfers
REJECT → Goal remains unchanged

Implement this end-to-end, not just as a UI visibility change.
