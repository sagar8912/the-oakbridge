Act as a Principal Full-Stack Engineer / Solution Architect with 15+ years of production experience.

We are continuing:

PHASE 1.B — KNOWLEDGE BASE COMPLETION

Completed or already implemented in previous slices:

- Slice 1a: Knowledge Base mutation authorization hardening
- Slice 2: Approved/current Knowledge Base article body retrieval
- Slice 3: Publish → Cache Revalidation flow

IMPORTANT:

Do NOT reimplement or redesign completed slices unless you discover a genuine defect that blocks this task.

We are now starting ONLY:

SLICE 4 — KNOWLEDGE BASE END-USER READER UI, NAVIGATION, AND SAFE CONTENT CONSUMPTION

This should be treated as a complete production-quality implementation slice, not a superficial UI patch.

==================================================
BUSINESS CONTEXT
==================================================

The client’s vision for the Knowledge Base is NOT currently a chatbot.

The Knowledge Base should function as the current approved source of truth for:

- Business policies
- Procedures
- Standards
- Operating processes
- Employee guidance
- Training documentation
- Technical documentation
- Engineering documentation
- Application documentation

The user experience should feel like a structured internal knowledge repository, similar conceptually to navigating a SharePoint-style knowledge/documentation site.

Users should be able to:

Knowledge Base
        ↓
Browse Categories / Collections
        ↓
Find relevant Articles
        ↓
Open an Article
        ↓
Read the current APPROVED content
        ↓
Navigate related/interlinked knowledge

Do NOT implement:

- Chatbot
- RAG answer generation
- LLM assistant
- MCP
- Agent orchestration
- Embedding generation redesign
- Azure migration
- TOW Vision integration yet unless a tiny shared component is absolutely required

Those are outside this slice.

==================================================
STEP 1 — RE-AUDIT THE READER-SIDE IMPLEMENTATION
==================================================

Before modifying code, inspect the current repository and identify the exact existing reader-side Knowledge Base architecture.

Inspect:

1. Existing routes such as:
   - /kb
   - /knowledge
   - /knowledge-base
   - dynamic article routes
   - category/collection routes

2. Identify:
   - existing placeholder pages
   - routes returning null
   - incomplete reader components
   - duplicate implementations
   - dead/stub code

3. Existing article APIs:
   - approved/current body endpoint from Slice 2
   - article metadata/list APIs
   - category/collection APIs
   - search APIs if present

4. Existing shared components:
   - article renderer
   - react-markdown components
   - RichTextDisplay
   - breadcrumbs
   - cards
   - sidebar/navigation
   - loading states
   - error states

5. Existing KB-Admin article rendering.

Determine whether KB-Admin already has a working article renderer that should be reused/shared.

6. Existing permissions:
   - reader authorization
   - kb_role
   - Viewer/User/Admin/Super Admin behavior

Do not weaken authorization.

7. Existing cache behavior:
   - cached article content
   - revalidation tags from Slice 3

Before coding, briefly report:

- Current reader architecture
- Exact reader gaps
- Existing reusable components
- Files/routes likely to be changed
- Any blocker that could affect the implementation

Then continue with implementation unless a truly destructive architectural ambiguity exists.

Do not stop for minor implementation choices that can safely follow existing project patterns.

==================================================
STEP 2 — KNOWLEDGE BASE LANDING PAGE
==================================================

Implement or complete a proper end-user Knowledge Base landing page.

The landing page should provide a clear entry point into the Knowledge Base.

It should use real data from the existing Knowledge Base architecture.

Provide, based on what the existing data model supports:

- Knowledge Base title/header
- Short description/purpose
- Search entry point if existing search architecture can be safely reused
- Categories or collections
- Recently updated or relevant articles only if existing APIs/data support it safely
- Clear navigation

Do not invent fake static Knowledge Base categories.

Use database/API-backed data.

The page must have:

- Loading state
- Empty state
- Error state
- Permission-aware behavior

An empty Knowledge Base should not show a blank screen or null.

Example:

Knowledge Base

[Search knowledge...]

Policies
Procedures
Training
Engineering
Applications

Recently Updated
- Article A
- Article B

This is conceptual only.

Follow the existing application design system.

==================================================
STEP 3 — CATEGORY / COLLECTION NAVIGATION
==================================================

Implement category/collection browsing using the existing data model.

When a user opens a category/collection:

Show eligible APPROVED articles.

Display useful metadata where available:

- Article title
- Short description/excerpt if safely available
- Last updated
- Category
- Status only where useful to readers

Do NOT expose:

- unauthorized articles
- drafts
- unpublished private content
- admin-only metadata unnecessarily

Support:

- Empty category
- Missing category
- Unauthorized category/content
- API failure

Use meaningful UI states.

Do not silently show:

“No results”

when an API actually failed.

Differentiate:

EMPTY
vs
ERROR
vs
UNAUTHORIZED.

==================================================
STEP 4 — ARTICLE DETAIL PAGE
==================================================

Implement a complete production-quality article reader.

Use the APPROVED/current article body API implemented in Slice 2.

An article page should display:

1. Title

2. Approved/current article content

3. Useful metadata:
   - category/collection
   - last updated
   - version if appropriate
   - status only if relevant to the reader

4. Breadcrumb navigation:

Knowledge Base
   >
Category
   >
Article

5. Back/navigation behavior.

6. Internal Knowledge Base links.

7. Proper content formatting.

==================================================
STEP 5 — MARKDOWN / CONTENT RENDERING
==================================================

Use ONE consistent rendering model whenever possible.

Inspect KB-Admin.

If KB-Admin already has a reliable Markdown renderer, reuse or extract a shared renderer rather than implementing an unrelated second rendering architecture.

Support according to existing architecture:

- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Bold / italic
- Ordered lists
- Unordered lists
- Links
- Tables if currently supported
- Code blocks if currently supported
- Blockquotes if currently supported

Do not add unnecessary third-party packages if existing libraries already solve this.

Security:

- Avoid unsafe raw HTML execution.
- Sanitize rendered content according to existing project patterns.
- Do not introduce XSS risks.

==================================================
STEP 6 — INTERNAL KB ARTICLE LINKS
==================================================

Articles should be able to link to other Knowledge Base articles.

Inspect how Markdown links are currently stored.

Where possible:

Use stable:
- slug
OR
- article ID

for internal KB navigation.

Internal article links should:

- Open the correct reader route
- Preserve stable navigation
- Not hardcode localhost
- Not depend on environment-specific absolute URLs

Handle:

- valid KB article links
- missing/deleted target
- unpublished target
- unauthorized target

A broken internal link must not crash the page.

==================================================
STEP 7 — READER PERMISSIONS
==================================================

This is critical.

Do not solve reader accessibility by globally weakening Knowledge Base authorization.

Preserve the current authorized read model from previous slices.

Server-side authorization must remain authoritative.

Ensure:

- authorized users can read approved content they are allowed to access
- unauthorized users cannot access restricted article bodies by manually entering URLs
- drafts cannot leak
- unpublished content cannot leak
- Viewer/User roles do not accidentally receive admin/edit privileges
- Admin/Super Admin behavior remains intact

If C1 reader policy is still marked TBD:

Do NOT invent a new broad access policy.

Implement the UI using the currently approved authorization behavior.

Keep C1 documented as TBD where necessary.

Do not block the entire reader implementation merely because future cross-app read-policy decisions are unresolved.

==================================================
STEP 8 — LOADING, EMPTY, ERROR, AND ACCESS STATES
==================================================

Remove silent-null UX.

Every reader flow should clearly distinguish:

LOADING

EMPTY

NOT FOUND

UNAUTHORIZED

UNPUBLISHED

SERVER/API ERROR

Examples:

Instead of:

blank page

show:

“No published articles are available in this category.”

Instead of silently returning null:

“We couldn’t load this article. Please try again.”

Use the application’s existing error/toast/state patterns.

Do not expose technical database errors to normal users.

Log useful server-side details according to existing project patterns.

==================================================
STEP 9 — NAVIGATION UX
==================================================

Ensure a user never feels trapped inside an article.

Provide sensible navigation:

KB Home
    ↓
Category
    ↓
Article
    ↓
Related/internal links
    ↓
Back / breadcrumbs

Where existing app layout supports it, consider:

- sidebar category navigation
- breadcrumbs
- search link
- article navigation

Do not over-engineer a completely new design system.

Reuse existing layout/styles.

Responsive behavior should not break existing mobile/tablet layouts.

==================================================
STEP 10 — SEARCH ENTRY POINT
==================================================

Do NOT redesign full search yet.

Search improvements are a later slice.

However:

If an existing functional KB search endpoint/component exists, expose a safe search entry point in the Reader UI.

Do not duplicate search implementations.

If search architecture is incomplete:

Add a clear extension point/place for search but do not build a new complex search engine in this slice.

Document it as pending Slice 8/Search work.

==================================================
STEP 11 — CACHE INTEGRATION
==================================================

The Reader UI must use the approved content/cache architecture established in Slice 2 and Slice 3.

Validate:

Published article
       ↓
Approved article API
       ↓
Cached reader response
       ↓
Reader UI

Then:

Article updated/published
       ↓
Revalidation
       ↓
Reader receives latest approved content

Do not create an independent client-side cache that causes permanently stale article content.

Use the existing cache strategy.

==================================================
STEP 12 — PERFORMANCE
==================================================

Avoid obvious N+1 API/database patterns.

Do not load full article bodies when merely rendering large article lists unless necessary.

Article listing should preferably retrieve metadata.

Article detail should retrieve body/content.

Respect pagination where existing APIs support it.

Do not fetch every Knowledge Base article on every page load.

==================================================
STEP 13 — TESTING
==================================================

Add/update tests using the repository’s existing testing architecture.

Do not introduce a new test framework.

Cover at minimum:

TEST 1:
Knowledge Base landing page loads successfully.

TEST 2:
Categories/collections display correctly.

TEST 3:
Approved article appears in appropriate listing.

TEST 4:
Draft article does NOT appear to unauthorized/normal reader.

TEST 5:
Published article detail loads correct approved body.

TEST 6:
Latest approved version is displayed.

TEST 7:
Missing article returns proper Not Found UX.

TEST 8:
Unauthorized article returns correct access behavior.

TEST 9:
Unpublished article does not leak.

TEST 10:
Empty category displays meaningful empty state.

TEST 11:
API failure displays proper error state rather than blank/null.

TEST 12:
Markdown headings/lists/links render correctly.

TEST 13:
Internal KB link navigates to target article.

TEST 14:
Broken internal link fails gracefully.

TEST 15:
Reader cannot gain mutation/edit access.

TEST 16:
Cache/revalidation integration continues to work.

TEST 17:
Existing KB-Admin workflows are not broken.

Where feasible, run:

- targeted Vitest tests
- component tests
- API tests
- typecheck
- lint

If PowerShell ExecutionPolicy blocks Cursor's shell:

Do not silently claim tests passed.

Give me exact commands to execute manually.

==================================================
STEP 14 — SCOPE CONTROL
==================================================

Strictly do NOT implement:

- TOW Vision → KB integration
- Item/Goal → KB linking
- Full search redesign
- Chatbot
- RAG
- Embeddings redesign
- MCP
- Azure migration
- Version restore changes
- Unrelated authorization redesign
- Production environment configuration changes

Do not modify .env files.

Do not add secrets.

Do not modify unrelated TOW functionality.

==================================================
STEP 15 — IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
==================================================

Implement this as a coherent production slice.

Prefer:

Existing components
       +
Existing APIs
       +
Shared renderer
       +
Existing permissions
       +
Existing cache
       ↓
Complete Reader experience

over creating parallel systems.

Do not create:

- duplicate article APIs without reason
- duplicate Markdown renderers
- duplicate category models
- duplicate authorization logic

==================================================
STEP 16 — FINAL VALIDATION
==================================================

Before declaring Slice 4 complete:

Trace this scenario end-to-end:

Authorized User
       ↓
Knowledge Base Home
       ↓
Select Category
       ↓
See approved articles
       ↓
Open Article
       ↓
Approved/current body displayed
       ↓
Follow internal KB link
       ↓
Open related article

Then test:

Unauthorized User
       ↓
Direct article URL
       ↓
Protected correctly

Then:

Admin publishes updated article
       ↓
Cache revalidation
       ↓
Reader displays updated approved version

Confirm all three flows.

==================================================
FINAL RESPONSE REQUIRED FROM CURSOR
==================================================

After implementation provide a structured report:

1. ROOT CAUSE / PREVIOUS GAPS

Explain why the Knowledge Base reader experience was incomplete.

2. ARCHITECTURE BEFORE

Show:

DB
→ APIs
→ incomplete/null reader

3. ARCHITECTURE AFTER

Show:

KB database
→ Approved/current body API
→ Cache
→ Reader routes
→ Category/article navigation
→ Rendered approved content

4. EXACT FILES CHANGED

Group by:

- Reader pages/routes
- Shared components
- APIs if changed
- Authorization
- Tests
- Documentation

5. REUSED EXISTING COMPONENTS

Explain what was reused rather than duplicated.

6. PERMISSION BEHAVIOR

Reader vs Editor vs Admin/Super Admin.

7. ROUTE STRUCTURE

List all reader-facing routes implemented/changed.

8. CACHE BEHAVIOR

Explain integration with Slice 3.

9. TEST RESULTS

Show actual PASS/FAIL.

Never say tests passed if they were not executed.

10. EXACT MANUAL COMMANDS

Give copy-pasteable commands if shell execution was blocked.

11. MANUAL STAGING UAT

Give exact click-by-click validation steps.

12. REMAINING RISKS

Classify each as:

BLOCKER
TECHNICAL DEBT
FUTURE PHASE
OUT OF SCOPE

13. CONFIRM SCOPE

Explicitly confirm that you did NOT implement:

- Vision integration
- RAG
- chatbot
- MCP
- Azure migration

IMPORTANT:

Do not move to the next Phase 1.B slice automatically.

STOP after Slice 4 is fully implemented and reported.

Wait for my explicit approval before starting:
- KB role/admin operations
- TOW/OOO → KB linking
- Search improvements
- Version restore
- Retrieval readiness
