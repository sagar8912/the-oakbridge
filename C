Good. The architecture audit is complete.

Do NOT implement code yet.

Now convert the audit into a detailed Phase 1.B implementation plan.

For each implementation slice, provide:

1. Exact problem/gap being solved
2. Existing files/components/APIs that will be reused
3. Exact files likely to be changed
4. Database migration required or not
5. API changes required
6. Permission/security impact
7. Tests required
8. Dependencies on earlier steps
9. Acceptance criteria

Use this implementation order unless your audit found a critical dependency requiring adjustment:

1. Authorization/security prerequisites required for safe KB reads
2. Approved/current article body API
3. Publish → cache revalidation flow
4. End-user Knowledge Base reader/navigation
5. KB role/admin operations validation
6. TOW/OOO item/goal/Vision → KB article linking
7. Version history/restore validation
8. Search/interlinked article improvements
9. Retrieval-readiness cleanup only — no RAG/chatbot implementation

Also clearly separate:

MUST HAVE FOR PHASE 1.B
vs
NICE TO HAVE / FUTURE

Important:
- Do not modify production code yet.
- Do not implement RAG, chatbot, embeddings, MCP, or Azure migration.
- Do not create duplicate KB architecture.
- Preserve existing production behavior.
- Highlight any business requirement that needs client confirmation before coding.

At the end, recommend the smallest first coding slice we should implement and test independently.
