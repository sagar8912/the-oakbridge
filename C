Act as a Principal Full-Stack Engineer / Solution Architect with 15+ years of production experience.

We have completed Phase 1.B Slice 4 — Knowledge Base Reader UI and Navigation.

DO NOT start Slice 5 yet.

Before moving forward, perform a complete stabilization, dependency reconciliation, regression review, and validation of Slices 1a through 4.

This is a RELEASE-GATE validation step.

==================================================
CURRENT STATE
==================================================

Completed:

Slice 1a:
Knowledge Base mutation authorization hardening

Slice 2:
Approved/current Knowledge Base article body API

Slice 3:
Publish → Cache Revalidation

Slice 4:
Knowledge Base Reader UI / Navigation / Approved Content Consumption

You identified the following remaining items:

1. Full search not built
   Classification: FUTURE PHASE / Slice 8

2. kb_role is not available in client user context, which can cause:
   navigation visible → user clicks → API returns 403
   Classification: TECHNICAL DEBT

3. package.json dependency changes require pnpm install / lockfile reconciliation
   Classification: BLOCKER

4. Hierarchy currently shows all approved nodes without article-count filtering
   Classification: TECHNICAL DEBT

There are currently approximately 55 changed files across the work done so far.

DO NOT blindly continue development until the current state is clean and validated.

==================================================
STEP 1 — REVIEW ALL CHANGED FILES
==================================================

Inspect every changed file from Slices 1a–4.

Group them into:

A. Slice 1a — Authorization
B. Slice 2 — Approved Body API
C. Slice 3 — Cache/Revalidation
D. Slice 4 — Reader UI
E. Tests
F. Documentation
G. Dependency/package changes
H. Potentially unrelated changes

For every potentially unrelated file:

Explain:
- why it changed
- whether the change is required
- whether it should remain

Do NOT keep unrelated modifications simply because they already exist.

Check specifically that we did NOT unintentionally modify:

- TOW business logic
- Goals
- Items
- Todos
- Voting
- Team permissions unrelated to KB
- RAG
- chatbot
- embeddings
- MCP
- Azure migration
- production environment configuration
- unrelated authentication logic

Return a concise changed-files audit before making additional production changes.

==================================================
STEP 2 — FIX THE DEPENDENCY / LOCKFILE BLOCKER
==================================================

You reported:

“Lockfile needs pnpm install after package.json deps — BLOCKER until install”

Analyze exactly:

1. Which package.json file(s) changed?
2. Which dependencies were added/removed/updated?
3. Why was each dependency required?
4. Was a new dependency actually necessary, or could an existing repository dependency have been reused?
5. Is the workspace lockfile currently inconsistent?

If the new dependency is genuinely required:

Provide the exact correct pnpm install command from the correct repository directory.

Use the monorepo’s existing package-manager/workspace conventions.

Update the lockfile normally through pnpm.

DO NOT manually edit pnpm-lock.yaml.

If the dependency is unnecessary:

Remove it and reuse existing packages instead.

After reconciliation verify:

- package.json
- pnpm-lock.yaml
- workspace resolution
- no accidental dependency version drift

Do not upgrade unrelated dependencies.

==================================================
STEP 3 — BUILD / TYPECHECK VALIDATION
==================================================

Validate every affected application.

At minimum inspect:

- kb-admin
- OOO/TOW if Reader UI touches it
- shared packages used by these apps

Run the existing repository-supported commands for:

1. TypeScript typecheck
2. Build
3. Lint where configured
4. Dependency resolution

Do not invent new scripts.

If Cursor shell is blocked by PowerShell ExecutionPolicy:

Give me exact copy-pasteable commands with:

- exact folder
- exact command
- purpose
- expected success result

Never claim a command passed if it was not actually executed.

==================================================
STEP 4 — RUN COMPLETE TARGETED TEST SUITE
==================================================

Validate all functionality introduced in Slices 1a–4.

SLICE 1A TESTS:

- Unauthenticated KB mutation blocked
- Viewer mutation blocked
- Editor permitted edit succeeds
- Admin/Super Admin behavior preserved
- Direct mutation bypass blocked

SLICE 2 TESTS:

- Approved/current article body returned
- Correct version returned
- Draft not leaked
- Unauthorized read blocked
- Missing article handled properly
- No silent valid-result null

SLICE 3 TESTS:

- Publish triggers cache revalidation
- Updated approved body becomes available
- Cache does not remain permanently stale
- Revalidation key behavior is correct
- Failed revalidation behaves safely

SLICE 4 TESTS:

- KB home loads
- Hierarchy/category navigation works
- Approved articles listed
- Article detail renders
- Markdown renders correctly
- Draft/unpublished articles hidden
- Unauthorized article protected
- Missing article handled
- Empty category handled
- API failure handled
- Internal navigation works
- No mutation access introduced through reader UI

Provide:

PASS
FAIL
NOT RUN

for every test category.

Never label NOT RUN as PASS.

==================================================
STEP 5 — VERIFY THE READER END-TO-END FLOW
==================================================

Trace this flow manually and technically:

Authorized user
    ↓
Knowledge Base navigation
    ↓
KB Home
    ↓
Category / hierarchy
    ↓
Approved article list
    ↓
Article detail
    ↓
Approved/current article body
    ↓
Markdown rendering
    ↓
Internal navigation

Then verify negative paths:

Unauthorized user
    ↓
Direct URL
    ↓
Correct 403 / access behavior

Draft article
    ↓
Normal reader
    ↓
Must not leak

Missing article
    ↓
Meaningful 404 UX

API failure
    ↓
Meaningful error
    ↓
No blank/null page

==================================================
STEP 6 — ANALYZE kb_role CLIENT CONTEXT ISSUE
==================================================

Do NOT blindly fix it yet.

Analyze this known technical debt:

“kb_role not on client user context → navigation visible, then API returns 403”

Explain:

1. Where server-side KB authorization currently gets kb_role.
2. What client-side user/session context currently contains.
3. Why navigation can be visible to a user who receives 403.
4. Whether adding kb_role to client context is safe.
5. Whether the better solution is:
   A. permission-aware navigation endpoint
   B. server-rendered authorization
   C. enriched session/user context
   D. another existing project pattern

Do NOT expose sensitive authorization internals unnecessarily to the client.

Recommend the safest smallest solution.

Mark whether this should be:

BLOCKER before Slice 5

or

First task inside Slice 5.

==================================================
STEP 7 — REVIEW HIERARCHY TECHNICAL DEBT
==================================================

You reported:

“Hierarchy shows all approved nodes — no article-count filter”

Analyze:

- Does this cause empty categories/sections to appear?
- Is it functionally incorrect or simply UX improvement?
- Does fixing it require expensive N+1 queries?
- Can existing metadata/count APIs solve it efficiently?

Do NOT implement a complex query redesign now.

Classify as:

BLOCKER

SLICE 5/8 enhancement

or

ACCEPTABLE TECHNICAL DEBT

==================================================
STEP 8 — VERIFY CACHE CONFIGURATION RISKS
==================================================

Revalidate Slice 3 known concerns:

- KB_REVALIDATE_API_KEY behavior
- KB Admin ↔ OOO/TOW revalidation path
- getOOOOrigin configuration
- localhost/staging behavior
- failure handling
- stale-until-TTL behavior

Do not expose secrets.

Do not modify env files.

Tell me exactly which environment variable names must be configured, but never print secret values.

==================================================
STEP 9 — CHECK PRODUCTION SAFETY
==================================================

Confirm:

- No database destructive migration
- No broad authorization weakening
- No draft data leakage
- No service-role credential exposed client-side
- No public endpoint accidentally created
- No existing KB Admin workflow broken
- No unrelated TOW workflow broken
- No environment-specific localhost URL hardcoded for deployed environments

==================================================
STEP 10 — FINAL RELEASE-GATE REPORT
==================================================

Give me a structured report:

1. FILE CHANGE AUDIT
Total files changed and categorized by slice.

2. DEPENDENCY STATUS
Whether pnpm/lockfile blocker is resolved.

3. BUILD STATUS
For each affected app:
PASS / FAIL / NOT RUN

4. TEST STATUS
Slice 1a:
PASS / FAIL / NOT RUN

Slice 2:
PASS / FAIL / NOT RUN

Slice 3:
PASS / FAIL / NOT RUN

Slice 4:
PASS / FAIL / NOT RUN

5. SECURITY STATUS

6. READER END-TO-END STATUS

7. BLOCKERS BEFORE SLICE 5

8. TECHNICAL DEBT

9. FUTURE-SCOPE ITEMS

10. EXACT MANUAL UAT STEPS

11. EXACT COMMANDS I SHOULD RUN MANUALLY IF ANYTHING COULD NOT BE EXECUTED

IMPORTANT:

Do NOT start Slice 5 automatically.

Do NOT implement:
- Search engine
- Vision → KB
- Item/Goal linking
- RAG
- chatbot
- MCP
- Azure migration
- Version restore

Stop after the stabilization report and wait for my approval.
