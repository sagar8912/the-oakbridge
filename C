Act as a Principal Full-Stack Engineer / Solution Architect with 15+ years of enterprise workflow experience.

We need to implement the Goal Transfer Approval Process exactly as discussed with the client (John) in today’s meeting.

Important Context

The current Goal Transfer functionality is already working and can be pushed to production.

Current behavior:

* Super Admin can transfer a goal directly from Team A → Team B.
* The goal is immediately moved.
* Owner and goal level can be changed during transfer.
* Normal users do not have transfer access.

John approved this for the immediate release, but requested a future-state movement approval workflow to avoid Super Admin becoming responsible for all data cleanliness decisions.

This work should be implemented as a new approval scaffolding, not by breaking the current transfer functionality.

⸻

John’s Exact Requirement

A transfer should not always move the goal immediately.

Instead:

User requests transfer
→ Transfer enters a Pending Movement queue
→ Appropriate permissioned reviewer receives the request
→ Reviewer can Approve or Reject
→ Goal moves only after approval

Example:

* John Sweet transfers a goal to another team.
* A Team Admin or designated reviewer checks the request.
* Reviewer may reject it if the goal belongs to a different team.

John specifically wants this integrated into:

* My Items
* Pending Movements
* Approval queue / transfer workflow

⸻

Architecture Requirements

1. New Transfer Request Entity

Create a dedicated workflow entity instead of directly updating the goal.

Suggested table: goal_transfer_requests

Fields:

* id
* goal_id
* source_team_id
* target_team_id
* requested_owner_id
* requested_goal_level
* requested_by_user_id
* status (PENDING | APPROVED | REJECTED | CANCELLED)
* approval_notes
* approved_by_user_id
* approved_at
* rejected_by_user_id
* rejected_at
* created_at
* updated_at

Add indexes and foreign keys.

⸻

2. Permission Model

Implement using the current RBAC model, but keep it compatible with future ABAC/PDP migration.

Can Request Transfer

* Super Admin
* Team Admin
* Team Owner
* Any role that currently has transfer capability

Can Approve/Reject

* Target Team Admin
* Super Admin
* Explicitly designated approver (future ABAC hook)

Cannot Approve

* Standard users
* Editors
* Viewers

Do NOT implement full ABAC yet, but create clean authorization hooks for future attribute-based policies.

⸻

3. UI Changes

Goal Page

Replace direct transfer with:

Step 1 — Create Transfer Request

* Select target team
* Select owner
* Select goal level
* Submit Request

Step 2 — Confirmation

Show:

* Request ID
* Status = Pending
* Awaiting approval by target team

Do NOT move the goal yet.

⸻

4. Pending Movement Queue

Add a new section in the existing workflow/navigation:

My Items → Pending Movements

Show:

* Goal name
* Source team
* Target team
* Requested by
* Requested owner
* Requested goal level
* Request date
* Status

Approvers should see:

* Approve button
* Reject button
* Comment box

Requestors should see:

* Pending
* Approved
* Rejected
* Cancel Request (while pending)

⸻

5. Approval Behavior

Approve

When approved:

* Goal.team_id = target_team_id
* Goal.owner_id = requested_owner_id
* Goal.goal_level = requested_goal_level
* Create audit log entry
* Mark request APPROVED
* Send notification to requestor

Reject

When rejected:

* Goal remains unchanged
* Request marked REJECTED
* Store rejection reason
* Notify requestor

⸻

6. Audit & Compliance

Create immutable audit events:

* goal.transfer.requested
* goal.transfer.approved
* goal.transfer.rejected
* goal.transfer.cancelled

Audit must include:

* actor
* timestamp
* old values
* requested values
* final decision

This is important for future enterprise governance.

⸻

7. Backward Compatibility

Critical:

* Keep the existing direct-transfer endpoint operational for the current production release.
* Add a feature flag or workflow mode if needed.
* The new approval workflow should be introduced without breaking current staging functionality.

Suggested:
TRANSFER_APPROVAL_ENABLED=true

When false:

* Current direct transfer behavior.

When true:

* Create transfer request workflow.

⸻

8. Notifications

Implement lightweight notifications (reuse existing patterns if available):

Request Created

Target team approvers are notified.

Request Approved

Requestor is notified.

Request Rejected

Requestor is notified with reason.

⸻

9. Manual UAT Scenarios

Implement and verify:

Scenario A — Team Admin requests transfer

Expected:

* Request created.
* Goal remains in original team.
* Status = Pending.

Scenario B — Approver approves

Expected:

* Goal moves to target team.
* Owner updates.
* Goal level updates.
* Audit log created.

Scenario C — Approver rejects

Expected:

* Goal stays in source team.
* Status = Rejected.
* Rejection reason visible.

Scenario D — Unauthorized user

Expected:

* No transfer request UI.
* API returns 403.

Scenario E — Pending queue

Expected:

* Request visible in My Items → Pending Movements.

⸻

10. Deliverables

Provide:

1. Database migration.
2. New API routes.
3. UI components added.
4. Authorization rules.
5. Audit implementation.
6. Feature flag behavior.
7. Test results.
8. Exact manual staging UAT steps.

Important:
Do NOT work on voting, KB, RAG, MCP, Azure migration, or unrelated permissions in this task.
Focus only on the Goal Transfer Approval Process scaffolding requested by John.
