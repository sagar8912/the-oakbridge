Act as a Principal Full-Stack / Platform Architect with 15+ years of experience.

We are starting Phase 1.B — Knowledge Base Completion.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT modify any code in this step.

First perform a complete architecture audit of the existing Knowledge Base implementation across the monorepo.

Business context:
- Knowledge Base = approved/current source of truth for policies, procedures, standards, training, business processes and technical documentation.
- TOW/OOO = problems, bugs, features, goals and improvements being worked on.
- Chatbot/RAG is NOT part of the current implementation phase.

Analyze and report:

1. Existing KB database tables:
   - articles
   - article_content
   - article_versions
   - categories/collections
   - permissions/roles
   - related tables

2. Existing KB APIs:
   - article list
   - article detail
   - article content/body
   - create/update
   - publish/version
   - search
   - cache/revalidation

3. Existing KB-Admin UI:
   - article creation
   - editing
   - publishing
   - versioning
   - rendering

4. Existing end-user KB pages:
   - /kb routes
   - pages returning null/stubs
   - incomplete pages

5. Existing rendering approach:
   - react-markdown
   - RichTextDisplay
   - HTML/Markdown handling

6. Existing authorization:
   - kb_role
   - Viewer/User/Admin/Super Admin
   - server/service access

7. Existing caching:
   - unstable_cache
   - cache tags
   - revalidate APIs

8. Existing TOW/OOO → KB integration.

9. Identify the top gaps blocking Phase 1.B.

Return:
- Current architecture flow
- Exact files involved
- Existing reusable components
- Missing functionality
- Security concerns
- Recommended implementation order

Do NOT implement anything yet.
