Continue Phase 1.B — Slice 9: Vision ↔ Knowledge Base integration.

OBJECTIVE:
Map Vision sections to authoritative KB articles so strategy content points to living documentation.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. MAPPING MODEL
    Create a mapping between Vision section identifiers and KB articles.
2. VISION RENDERING
    When a Vision section has a mapping:

* show a ‘Read the authoritative article’ card
* display article status and last updated timestamp
* deep-link to the reader article

3. KB RENDERING
    On article pages, show:

* linked Vision sections
* strategic context
* navigation back to Vision

4. CACHE
    Vision pages must refresh when a mapped article is published.
5. TESTS
    Cover:

* mapped section rendering
* unmapped fallback
* publish refresh
* broken mapping handling

6. STOP
    Provide final integration summary and remaining out-of-scope items.
