Act as a Principal Full-Stack Engineer.

We have completed these UATs successfully:

* Article create = PASS
* Save draft = PASS
* Publish/Approve = PASS
* Reader visibility = PASS

Current failing scenario:
GOAL ↔ KNOWLEDGE ARTICLE LINKING SEARCH

Observed behavior:

1. Approved article exists in KB:
    * Knowledge Base: TOW App
    * Journey: Technical Documents
    * Article title: UAT Final Test
    * Status: APPROVED
    * Reader URL works and displays the article.
2. On a Goal page, clicking “Add Knowledge Article” opens the modal.
3. Searching for “UAT Final Test” returns:
    “No approved articles matched.”

This means the article is published for readers but is NOT discoverable by the Goal-linking search endpoint/query.

Your task is to DEBUG and FIX ONLY this scenario.

Investigation checklist:

1. Identify the API/Server Action used by the “Add Knowledge Article” modal.
2. Trace the query that fetches approved articles.
3. Compare the query with the reader-side approved article query.
4. Verify whether the search is filtering by:
    * is_approved
    * status = APPROVED
    * is_published
    * deleted_at
    * journey visibility
    * knowledge base code
    * search index table
5. Check whether the article was approved but not inserted into the lookup/search table.
6. Check cache/revalidation behavior for the linking modal.
7. Verify slug/title normalization (spaces, casing, markdown title vs DB title).
8. Verify whether the modal searches only the currently selected KB and whether “All KBs” is actually respected.

Implementation requirements:

* Do NOT redesign the feature.
* Keep existing relationship model.
* Make approved articles immediately discoverable after approval.
* Ensure the modal can find articles by title substring.
* Preserve permission checks.

Acceptance criteria:

* Search “UAT Final Test” returns the approved article.
* Selecting it creates a Supports relationship.
* The Goal page shows the linked article card.
* The KB article Relationships tab shows the linked Goal.
* Reloading either page preserves the relationship.
* No regression to publish or reader flows.

Provide:

* Root cause summary.
* Files changed.
* Query before/after.
* Manual verification steps.
* Any migration/index/cache updates required.
