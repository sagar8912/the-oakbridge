Act as a Principal Full-Stack Engineer with 15+ years of production experience.

We are continuing Phase 1.B — Slice 6A: Goal/Item ↔ Knowledge Article linking foundation.

CURRENT STATE:

* Slice 1–5 are already implemented.
* KB Admin, approved-body API, publish workflow, cache revalidation, reader UI, and role admin ops are complete.
* Do NOT modify those completed slices.
* Do NOT start search, RAG, MCP, Azure migration, or Vision integration yet.

OBJECTIVE:
Create a generic relationship model so any Goal or Item can be linked to one or more KB articles, and any KB article can be linked back to Goals/Items.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. DATABASE
    Create a migration for a polymorphic link table, for example:

* entity_article_links
* id
* entity_type (‘goal’ | ‘item’)
* entity_id (UUID)
* article_id (UUID)
* relationship_type (‘supports’ | ‘references’ | ‘implementation’ | ‘policy’)
* created_by
* created_at

Add proper indexes and unique constraints to prevent duplicate links.

2. BACKEND SERVICES
    Implement reusable repository/service functions:

* linkArticleToEntity()
* unlinkArticleFromEntity()
* getArticlesForEntity()
* getEntitiesForArticle()

3. API ROUTES
    Add authenticated API endpoints for:

* POST /api/knowledge/links
* DELETE /api/knowledge/links/:id
* GET /api/knowledge/entity/:type/:id/articles
* GET /api/knowledge/article/:id/entities

4. AUTHORIZATION
    Reuse existing PDP/RBAC patterns.
    Only users with edit/manage permission on the target entity may create or remove links.
    Reader users may only read approved article links.
5. TESTS
    Add unit tests for:

* duplicate prevention
* authorization
* create/delete flows
* entity lookup
* article lookup

6. DOCUMENTATION
    Update docs/02_plans/kb-phase-1b-completion-implementation.md with:

* schema
* API contract
* authorization rules
* migration notes

7. STOP CONDITION
    After implementation, STOP and provide:

* files changed
* migration name
* API endpoints added
* test commands to run locally
* any blockers

Do NOT build UI in this slice. This slice is backend foundation only.
