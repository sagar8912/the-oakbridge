C1 Decision: Use a HYBRID read-access model.

Proceed with this rule:

1. Approved/Published Knowledge Base content that is explicitly referenced by an authorized TOW/OOO context (for example a Vision section) may be read by an authenticated user who already has permission to view that TOW context.

2. This scoped access must NOT grant the user unrestricted access to the entire Knowledge Base.

3. Draft, unpublished, private, restricted, authoring, editing, and admin KB functionality must continue to follow the existing kb_role / authorization model.

4. Enforce this server-side through a scoped approved-content read path. Do not simply remove kb_role checks globally.

5. The read endpoint must return only the approved/current version and must not expose draft/version history or privileged metadata unnecessarily.

Now proceed with ONLY Slice 2 — Approved/Current Article Body API.

Requirements:
- Identify the correct approved/current article version.
- Return stable article ID/slug, title, approved body, metadata required for rendering, status/version/last-updated where appropriate.
- Never silently return null when valid approved content exists.
- Clear 403, 404 and error responses.
- No draft leakage.
- Preserve caching/revalidation architecture.
- Remove or avoid hidden write side-effects from the read path where safely possible; specifically review the previously identified getArticleContent quiet UPDATE behavior.
- Do not start Reader UI, TOW Vision integration, search, RAG, chatbot, MCP, or unrelated work yet.

Add tests for:
1. Approved article retrieval
2. Scoped authenticated TOW-context read
3. User without valid TOW context or KB permission blocked
4. Draft/unpublished content not exposed
5. Missing article returns 404
6. Correct current approved version returned
7. Read operation does not perform unintended content mutation

Before editing, show:
- Current API/data flow
- Exact root gap
- Files to change
- Proposed smallest safe solution

Then implement Slice 2 only.

After implementation provide:
- Files changed
- API contract
- Authorization behavior
- Tests and exact commands/results
- Remaining risks

Do not proceed to Slice 3 until I explicitly approve it.
