Proceed with ONLY Slice 1a — Mutation Authorization Hardening.

Do NOT assume or decide C1–C5 yet. Keep all C1–C5 marked as TBD / client confirmation required.

Scope for this implementation only:

1. Find and secure any unguarded "use server" + service-role Knowledge Base content mutation paths.

2. Ensure article/content save and allowed workflow-transition operations use the correct existing EDIT authorization capability.

3. Do not incorrectly require ADMIN/MANAGE permission for normal editor operations if the existing permission model defines EDIT separately.

4. Enforce authorization server-side for every mutation.
UI hiding alone is not sufficient.

5. Preserve the current SQL PDP/PEP architecture.
Do NOT redesign or change SQL PDP/PEP logic in this slice.

6. Do NOT change:
- KB read-access rules
- C1 reader decision
- approve/publish semantics
- C2 reader route/home
- C3 linking scope
- C4 version restore behavior
- RAG/chatbot/embeddings
- Azure migration
- unrelated TOW functionality

Required permission behavior:
- Viewer: cannot mutate KB content
- Editor/authorized content editor: can perform permitted edit/save operations
- Admin/Super Admin: retains existing authorized capabilities
- Direct server/API mutation attempts must also be protected

Before editing:
- Show the exact vulnerable mutation paths/files you found
- Explain the current authorization gap
- Explain the smallest safe fix

Then implement Slice 1a only.

Add/update tests for:
1. Viewer mutation blocked
2. Editor permitted edit/save succeeds
3. Admin permitted operation succeeds
4. Unauthenticated mutation blocked
5. Direct mutation/API bypass blocked
6. Existing allowed behavior is not broken

After implementation provide:
- Root cause
- Exact files changed
- Authorization logic before vs after
- Tests added
- Exact test commands and results
- Any remaining risks

Do not proceed to Slice 2 / Approved Body API until I explicitly tell you.
