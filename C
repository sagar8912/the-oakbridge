Act as a Principal Full-Stack Engineer debugging a production UAT blocker.

Context:

* Repo: the-oakbridge-way
* Apps: apps/kb-admin and apps/ooo
* Phase 1.B migration is largely complete.
* The remaining blocker is Knowledge Article linking from Goals/Items.

What I manually verified in the UI:

1. KB Admin article exists: TOW App → Technical Documents.
2. Article status is APPROVED (Version 2).
3. Reader URL works: /Knowledge/TOWApp/technical-documents.
4. Article is visible in the end-user Knowledge reader.
5. Goal/Item → “Link Knowledge Article” modal cannot find the article.
6. Searching “UAT” or “UAT Final Test” returns “No approved articles matched.”

This means:

* Publish pipeline works.
* Reader visibility works.
* Approved article retrieval for the linking modal is failing.

Your task is to debug and fix ONLY this bug.

⸻

STEP 1 — Trace the modal request

Find the component that opens the “Add Knowledge Article” modal and identify:

* the API endpoint it calls
* the query parameters sent during search
* whether it searches by title, slug, code, or content

Check files such as:

* goal detail page
* item detail page
* knowledge article linking modal
* relationship/linking components
* any search hooks or query helpers

Do not change code yet.

Provide:

* exact frontend file path
* exact API route
* example request URL generated when typing “UAT”

⸻

STEP 2 — Inspect backend search API

Open the endpoint used by the modal and verify:

* approved status filter
* knowledge base filter
* tenant/workspace filter
* soft-delete filter
* published/body existence filter
* search field used (title vs name)

Add temporary debug logging if needed.

Then compare the query against the actual article row that is visible in the reader.

⸻

STEP 3 — Verify database data

Without making schema changes, inspect the article record for “UAT Final Test” and check:

* status
* is_published
* published_at
* current_version_id
* title
* slug
* knowledge_base_id
* category_id
* deleted_at

Explain which field causes the search query to exclude the article.

⸻

STEP 4 — Implement the fix

Apply the smallest possible production-safe fix.

Requirements:

* Linking modal must return all APPROVED and visible articles.
* Search by partial title must work (“UAT” should find “UAT Final Test”).
* KB dropdown filter must continue to work.
* Reader visibility rules must remain unchanged.
* No schema redesign.
* No unrelated refactors.

⸻

STEP 5 — Add regression tests

Add tests for:

* approved article appears in linking search
* draft article does not appear
* partial title search works
* KB filter restricts results correctly
* goal and item linking both use the same search behavior

Run only the affected test suites.

⸻

STEP 6 — Manual UAT checklist

After the fix, verify in the UI:

A. KB Admin

* Article shows APPROVED.

B. Reader

* Article page opens and displays content.

C. Goal linking

* Open any Goal.
* Click Link Knowledge Article.
* Type “UAT”.
* “UAT Final Test” appears.
* Select it and save.
* Related article appears on the Goal page.

D. Item linking

* Repeat the same flow for an OOO Item.

⸻

Important constraints

Do NOT:

* start RAG/chatbot work
* modify Vision integration
* redesign authentication
* change migration history
* touch Azure/MCP/vector DB code
* change unrelated APIs

Deliverables:

1. Root cause summary.
2. Files changed.
3. Before vs after behavior.
4. Test results.
5. Remaining risks (if any).
6. Exact manual UAT steps to reproduce and verify the fix.
