Act as a Principal Full-Stack Engineer / Solution Architect with 15+ years of production experience.

We have COMPLETED Phase 1.B Slices 1-4 in the TOW mono-repo.

Current completed work:

* Slice 1: Mutation authorization hardening
* Slice 2: Approved-body Source-of-Truth API
* Slice 3: Publish workflow + cache revalidation
* Slice 4: Reader UI + approved article rendering

Now proceed with ONLY Slice 5 — Knowledge Base Role Administration, TOW Linking, Search Foundation, and Retrieval Readiness.

CRITICAL SCOPE RULES:

* Do NOT touch Vision→KB integration.
* Do NOT implement RAG, chatbot, MCP, embeddings pipeline, or Azure migration.
* Do NOT redesign the SQL PDP/PEP architecture.
* Do NOT change existing auth/session model.
* Do NOT modify production environment secrets.
* Keep C1-C5 decisions marked as TBD / client confirmation required.

OBJECTIVE:
Prepare the Knowledge Base to behave like a SharePoint-style policy repository with proper role administration, cross-linking from TOW entities, foundational search, and retrieval-ready metadata.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

STEP 1 — ROLE ADMIN OPERATIONS

Goal:
Allow admins to manage KB roles without changing the underlying authorization architecture.

Tasks:

1. Add admin UI for kb_role management.
2. Support assigning/removing:
    * kb_admin
    * kb_editor
    * kb_reviewer
    * kb_reader
3. Validate permissions server-side.
4. Prevent privilege escalation.
5. Add audit logging for role changes.
6. Show role badges in the admin UI.

Files to inspect:

* apps/kb-admin/src/app/admin/*
* apps/kb-admin/src/lib/auth/*
* shared role utilities

Acceptance:

* Admin can assign and revoke KB roles.
* Non-admin receives 403.
* Audit entry is created for every role change.

STEP 2 — TOW ITEM/GOAL ↔ KB ARTICLE LINKING

Goal:
Enable items and goals to reference KB articles.

Tasks:

1. Add article reference model.
2. Support linking from:
    * Items
    * Goals
3. Store stable article identifiers (slug or article_id).
4. Add UI picker/search for approved articles.
5. Render linked articles in the item/goal detail sidebar.
6. Support multiple linked articles.

Files to inspect:

* apps/tow-app/src/app/item/*
* apps/tow-app/src/app/goal/*
* KB API routes

Acceptance:

* A goal can link multiple approved KB articles.
* Links survive article edits and new versions.
* Unapproved articles cannot be linked.

STEP 3 — SEARCH FOUNDATION (NOT FULL SEARCH ENGINE)

Goal:
Create a safe foundation for future search without implementing full-text infrastructure yet.

Tasks:

1. Add search service abstraction.
2. Implement article title/slug search.
3. Add approved-only filtering.
4. Add hierarchy/category filters.
5. Add pagination and sorting.
6. Keep implementation database-friendly.

Do NOT implement:

* Vector search
* Semantic search
* Embeddings
* External search engine

Acceptance:

* Search returns approved articles by title/slug.
* Filters work.
* API contract is stable for future expansion.

STEP 4 — RETRIEVAL-READY METADATA

Goal:
Prepare KB content for future RAG/retrieval without enabling RAG yet.

Tasks:

1. Add metadata fields:
    * canonical_slug
    * article_version
    * published_at
    * approved_by
    * source_system
    * section_path
    * retrieval_tags
    * content_hash
2. Populate metadata during publish.
3. Backfill existing approved articles where possible.
4. Keep metadata immutable for published versions.

Acceptance:

* Every approved article has retrieval metadata.
* Metadata is available via API.
* Existing published articles are not broken.

STEP 5 — NAVIGATION & UX STABILIZATION

Goal:
Make KB navigation reliable for authenticated users.

Tasks:

1. Hide KB nav when user lacks kb_role.
2. Remove visible-then-403 behavior.
3. Add graceful empty states.
4. Add breadcrumb navigation.
5. Add hierarchy tree expansion persistence.

Acceptance:

* Unauthorized users never see broken KB routes.
* Navigation is consistent across refreshes.

STEP 6 — TESTING & QUALITY GATE

Run or prepare commands:

* pnpm exec vitest run
* pnpm exec tsc –noEmit
* pnpm lint
* pnpm build (if dependencies are available)

Add tests for:

* Role assignment permissions
* Article linking rules
* Search filtering
* Retrieval metadata generation
* Navigation visibility

OUTPUT FORMAT

When finished, provide:

1. Files changed grouped by slice.
2. Migrations added.
3. APIs added or modified.
4. Tests added.
5. Manual UAT checklist.
6. Remaining risks.
7. Explicit PASS/FAIL gate for:
    * TypeScript
    * Lint
    * Tests
    * Build

IMPORTANT:
Work slice-by-slice and stop only if you encounter a true blocker (missing dependency, migration conflict, or architectural contradiction). Otherwise continue through all Slice 5 tasks and produce a complete implementation summary.
